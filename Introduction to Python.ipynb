For example, the dictionary class supports methods keys(), values(), and items(), which respec- tively produce a “view” of all keys, values, or (key,value) pairs within a dictionary. None of these methods produces an explicit list of results. Instead, the views that are produced are iterable objects based upon the actual contents of the dictionary. An explicit list of values from such an iteration can be immediately constructed by calling the list class constructor with the iteration as a parameter. For example, the syntax list(range(1000)) produces a list instance with values from 0 to 999, while the syntax list(d.values()) produces a list that has elements based upon the current values of dictionary d. We can similarly construct a tuple or set instance based upon a given iterable."

    "In Section 2.3.4, we will explain how to define a class whose instances serve as iterators. However, the most convenient technique for creating iterators in Python is through the use of generators. A generator is implemented with a syntax that is very similar to a function, but instead of returning values, a yield statement is executed to indicate each element of the series. As an example, consider the goal of determining all factors of a positive integer. For example, the number 100 has factors 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100. A traditional function might produce and return a list containing all factors, implemented as:"

On page 28, we noted that the built-in function, max, accepts an optional keyword parameter to specify a non-default order when computing a maximum. For example, a caller can use the syntax, max(a, b, key=abs), to determine which value has the larger absolute value.
