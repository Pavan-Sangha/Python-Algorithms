In this example, it would effectively check if the int class provides a sufficient definition for how to multiply an instance by a string, via the     mul     method. However, if that class does not implement such a behavior, Python checks the class defini- tion for the right-hand operand, in the form of a special method named     rmul (i.e., “right multiply”). This provides a way for a new user-defined class to support mixed operations that involve an instance of an existing class (given that the exist- ing class would presumably not have defined a behavior involving this new class). The distinction between     mul     and     rmul     also allows a class to define dif- ferent semantics in cases, such as matrix multiplication, in which an operation is noncommutative (that is, A   x may differ from x   A)."

Of course, if the parameter is an instance of a user- defined class, the original authors of the string class could not have known how that instance should be portrayed. So the string constructor calls a specially named method, foo.     str     (), that must return an appropriate string representation.\n",
    "Similar special methods are used to determine how to construct an int, float, or bool based on a parameter from a user-defined class. The conversion to a Boolean value is particularly important, because the syntax, if foo:, can be used even when foo is not formally a Boolean value (see Section 1.4.1).

This is a result of Python’s polymorphism. Literally, “polymorphism” means “many forms.” Although it is tempting to think of the other parameter of our     add     method as another Vector instance, we never declared it as such.

The new class will differ from the original in two ways: (1) if an attempted charge is rejected because it would have exceeded the credit limit, a $5 fee will be charged, and (2) there will be a mechanism for assess- ing a monthly interest charge on the outstanding balance, based upon an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) specified as a constructor parameter.\n",

To charge a fee for an invalid charge attempt, we override the existing charge method, thereby specializing it to provide the new functionality (although the new version takes advantage of a call to the overridden version).

Because there are no declared types in Python, this kind of polymorphism can be accom- plished without the need for a unifying abstract base class.

    "This implementation relies on two advanced Python techniques. The first is that we declare the ABCMeta class of the abc module as a metaclass of our Sequence class. A metaclass is different from a superclass, in that it provides a template for the class definition itself. Specifically, the ABCMeta declaration assures that the constructor for the class raises an error."

    "The second advanced technique is the use of the @abstractmethod decorator immediately before the     __len__     and    __getitem__     methods are declared. That de- clares these two particular methods to be abstract, meaning that we do not provide an implementation within our Sequence base class, but that we expect any concrete subclasses to support those two methods. Python enforces this expectation, by dis- allowing instantiation for any subclass that does not override the abstract methods with concrete implementations.\n",
    "The rest of the Sequence class definition provides tangible implementations for other behaviors, under the assumption that the abstract     len     and     getitem methods will exist in a concrete subclass. If you carefully examine the source code, the implementations of methods     contains     , index, and count do not rely on any assumption about the self instances, other than that syntax len(self) and self[j] are supported (by special methods     len     and     getitem     , respectively). \n",
    "In the remainder of this book, we omit the formality of using the abc module. If we need an “abstract” base class, we simply document the expectation that sub- classes provide assumed functionality, without technical declaration of the methods as abstract. But we will make use of the wonderful abstract base classes that are defined within the collections module (such as Sequence). To use such a class, we need only rely on standard inheritance techniques.\n",
    "For example, our Range class, from Code Fragment 2.6 of Section 2.3.5, is an example of a class that supports the     len     and     getitem     methods. But that class does not support methods count or index. Had we originally declared it with Sequence as a superclass, then it would also inherit the count and index methods. The syntax for such a declaration would begin as:\n",
    "class Range(collections.Sequence):\n",
    "Finally, we emphasize that if a subclass provides its own implementation of an inherited behaviors from a base class, the new definition overrides the inherited one. This technique can be used when we have the ability to provide a more effi- cient implementation for a behavior than is achieved by the generic approach. As an example, the general implementation of     contains     for a sequence is based on a loop used to search for the desired value. For our Range class, there is an opportunity for a more efficient determination of containment. For example, it is evident that the expression, 100000 in Range(0, 2000000, 100), should evalu- ate to True, even without examining the individual elements of the range, because the range starts with zero, has an increment of 100, and goes until 2 million; it must include 100000, as that is a multiple of 100 that is between the start and stop values. Exercise C-2.27 explores the goal of providing an implementation of Range.     contains     that avoids the use of a (time-consuming) loop."
